# AI-startup-funding-Trend
A small real-data project analyzing AI startup funding trends (2020–2024) using Python
*AI Startup Funding Trends (2020–2024)
This is a small data-driven project I built to explore how funding for AI startups evolved over the past five years. Using a simple dataset, I analyzed total investment amounts by year and by funding stage, and visualized the results using Python.
*About the Data
The dataset includes funding rounds (Seed to Series C) for AI companies from 2020 to 2024, with amounts shown in millions of USD. It’s a curated sample meant to simulate a real analyst workflow.
*What I Did
-Aggregated funding totals by year  
-Visualized funding by stage (Seed, Series A, B, C)  
- Wrote insights based on trends in late vs early-stage capital  
*Tools
-Python + pandas (data analysis)
-seaborn + matplotlib (charts)
-Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
*Run the Project
Open the (.ipynb) notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter to explore the code, data, and charts.
*Let me know if you'd like to collaborate or have feedback!
